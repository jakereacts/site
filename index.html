      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Jake â€” a gardener, baker, fibre artist, sci-fi fan, and political ranter living in Treaty 7 Territory. 
      Iâ€™m all about soil under the nails and space battles in the stars. If youâ€™re into anything from chickens to Chewbacca, youâ€™re in the right place.</p>

      <h2>Land Acknowledgement</h2>
      <p>I live and work in Treaty 7 territory, in Special Areas No. 2. This is the traditional and ancestral territory of the Blackfoot Confederacy, 
      the Tsuutâ€™ina Nation, and the Stoney Nakoda First Nation. I honour the Indigenous peoples who have cared for this land for generations â€” and continue to do so.</p>
